            Hi, I am Michael, I have been working as a software engineer for the
            past 15 years.

          <p className="">
            I'm a senior front-end engineer with extensive experience building web and app applications using React, React-Native, and TypeScript. My development journey started as a full-stack developer using Perl, .NET, and MySQL, MSSQL. Afterwards, I moved into front-end development at Paciolan using vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, and in 2018, I started working with React class components. A year later, I switched to functional components with hooks.

            I worked as a Senior Software Developer at Phase2, an agency, and served as a technical consultant for Northwell Health. My responsibilities included front-end development (60%), back-end development (30%), and research documentation (10%). For the front-end, mainly using React, React Native, TypeScript, and other tools, I created new features and maintained existing projects. Most back-end work involved database updates through Sequelize migrations and maintaining the existing dpx-service and dpx-message servers. The dpx-service manages service orchestration, including API management and error handling, while the dpx-message provides standardized messaging between projects. Recently, I improved web accessibility for the applications for both VoiceOver for Mac and Narrator for Windows, and migrated the database from MSSQL to PostgreSQL on AlloyDB for Sequelize migrations on the GCP platform. Additionally, I contributed to implementing GCP Vertex AI search with GenAI features, including prompt execution and dynamic content rendering using AI models.

            Before joining Phase2, I worked at Health Gorilla, which offers secure healthcare data solutions, as a front-end engineer. I collaborated closely with product managers, QA teams, and back-end developers. My tech stack included TypeScript, React, Redux, Webpack, and Git. I also led the development of version 2 of the client dashboard based on Module Federation, which I developed myself.

            During my time at iHerb, I was a front-end engineer for an e-commerce company specializing in healthcare products. I was part of the checkout team and worked closely with the UI and QA teams. We used React, Redux, TypeScript, and Next.js for desktop and mobile web applications, deploying updates through Jenkins CI/CD.
